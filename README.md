# SortableDraggablePage

## Project Description: 
This project implements a dynamic user interface utilizing the jQuery UI library's sortable feature. The interface includes functionalities such as adding rows, visually deleting empty rows, and dragging and dropping items from a menu to a row. Rows can be rearranged among themselves.

## Features
